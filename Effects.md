# Effects If The Project/System Fails
 
For the call management centre, there would be drastic effects to the business if the internal system fails.
 
There will be no computer matching between an RM and a customer. This means that random customers will call/be called by a random RM that are not best suited to aid the potentiality of a holiday package sale. This leads to no script/guideline appearing during an outbound call, which leads to decreasing the efficiency of the RM’s performance. This requires the employee to improvise and learn about the customer and their potential to purchase a holiday package during the call, decreasing overall customer relationship management.
 
Furthermore, during busy call times, there would be no ‘Interactive Voice Response Unit’ and thus no automatic call distributor to help queue and manage a large volume of customer calls. This will result in customers hanging up the phone if they are unwilling to wait in which they may not call back. Customers could move to competitor businesses, decreasing sales for the CMC.
