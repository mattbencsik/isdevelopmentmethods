# Competitive Advantages
 
One of the main attributes towards the success of a company is being able to outperform its competitors in the industry. The call management centre separates itself from its competitors in several ways.
 
1. 	Cost-effectiveness

The new system allows for the call centre to become more cost-effective. This primarily comes from the reduction of per-call handling time, allowing for more consumers to be reached, increasing the potential of sales oh holiday packages. Also, increasing call amounts per day, it reduces overall weekly wages for employees as there is no need to pay staff to work longer hours. 
 
2. 	Brand Loyalty

The call management centre’s allows for an increase in brand loyalty by implementing a system that ranks a customer with a score from 1-10. This ensures that the customers with the highest scores are served first; the higher the score, the higher the potential to purchase a holiday package. Furthermore, with customers that have previously purchased a package before, they have an increased tendency to re-purchase, due to receiving high quality customer service experience from their previous purchase.
 
3. 	Call Efficiency

Call efficiency is a primary way that the call management centre distinguishes itself from its competitors. The system creates a script/guideline corresponding to the customer’s pre analysed profile, to help RM’s maintain only essential conversation to best deliver a sale. Additionally, the system dials the customer number for outbound calls automatically, saving time for an employee to enter the details manually and waste precious sales time. In busy periods, an ‘Interactive Voice Response Unit’ is used to queue customers and interact with them while they wait to be served by retrieving any other additional information relating to their query. This will increase the efficiency of the call as the RM’s will be able to obtain more knowledge on the customer’s query prior to the call being connected. 
  

# Effects If The Project/System Fails
 
For the call management centre, there would be drastic effects to the business if the internal system fails.
 
There will be no computer matching between an RM and a customer. This means that random customers will call/be called by a random RM that are not best suited to aid the potentiality of a holiday package sale. This leads to no script/guideline appearing during an outbound call, which leads to decreasing the efficiency of the RM’s performance. This requires the employee to improvise and learn about the customer and their potential to purchase a holiday package during the call, decreasing overall customer relationship management.
 
Furthermore, during busy call times, there would be no ‘Interactive Voice Response Unit’ and thus no automatic call distributor to help queue and manage a large volume of customer calls. This will result in customers hanging up the phone if they are unwilling to wait in which they may not call back. Customers could move to competitor businesses, decreasing sales for the CMC.
