# Assumptions

1. The telephone number provided to customers does not direct them to a specific RM, rather directs them to the Automatic Call Distributor. From here they will either be directed to an RM via the Skill Matcher, or to the Interactive Voice Response.
2. There are different RM departments, specialising in different areas of customer care and travel knowledge. For example, one department may specialise in 'Hiking Trips' and issuing refunds.
3. There is a group of superior, high-ranking RMs. These RM's are the head of each department, and have high levels of expertise across multiple areas. High ranking customers will be directed to them. (A high score means between 7-10)
4. One element of the system is the Skill Matcher. This comprises of the profiler tool, RM profiles and customer profiles and deals with inflows of data. 
5. The system prioritizes inbound calls. During quiteter periods RM's will request a customer target list, and the Skill Matcher System will automatically dial a potential customer and display a script. 
6. The Skill Matcher system considers customer scores between 7-10 to be high scores.
7. The interactive voice response may alter the decision made by the Skill Matcher on which RM they may be directed to, as it extrapolates information about the reason for a customer call. 
8. RM's have the capability to transfer calls within and across departments, should they find a customer inquiry does not suit their area of expertise. This customer will be placed to the front of a queue. 
9. There is an external actor, Online Banking Tool, where payments are handled. The RMs deal directly with this service.
10. After a call has taken place, an RM will fill out a brief form to assist the system in updating customer and RM profiles.
