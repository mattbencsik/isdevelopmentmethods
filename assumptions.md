#. The telephone number provided to customers does not direct them to a specific RM, rather directs them to the Automatic Call Distributor. 
#. There are different RM departments, specialising in different areas of customer care and travel knowledge. For example, one department may specialise in 'Hiking Trips' and issuing refunds.
#. There is a group of superior, high-ranking RMs. These RM's are the head of each department, and have high levels of expertise across multiple areas. Very high ranking customers will be directed to them.
#. There is an RM department called 'General RM's', who do not have specific knowledge or skill-scores, but are responsible for transferring customers to appropriate RMs when the profiler tool is unable to find a clear match or there is a long wait for an RM. They exist to reduce waiting times and avoid customers being directed to the interactive voice response. 
#. There is an external actor, Online Banking Tool, where payments are handled. The RMs deal directly with this service.
#. One element of the system is the Skill Matcher System. This comprises of the profiler tool, RM profiles and customer profiles and is responsible for generating target outbound calling lists and scripts. 
#. The Skill Matcher system considers customer scores between 7-10 to be high scores.
#. After a call has taken place, an RM will fill out a brief form to assist the system in updating customer and RM profiles.
#. RM's have the capability to transfer calls within and across departments, should they find a customer inquiry does not suit their area of expertise. This customer will be placed to the front of a queue. 
#. The interactive voice response contributes data to the matching of an RM to customer, as it extrapolates information about the reason for a customer call.
