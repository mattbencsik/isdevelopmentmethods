Competitive Advantages:

One of the main attributes towards the success of a company is being able to outperform its competitors in the industry. The system's new ability to appropriately match customers with Relationship Managers with the highest knowledge and skills related to the customer's enquiry (eg. chosen destination) has resulted in multiple competitive advantages for the company.


1. Decrease in Customer waitime 
The system will improve call routing and dynamic call flow control for inbound and outbound calls. Providing RM's with the customer's profile and a script in a matter of seconds will decrease lead times and increase the delivery of selling the travel packages. 


2. Increased Customer Satisfaction 



(through profile matching, customer data collection and personalised service)

2. Speed (improved call routing and redirection will lend itself to an efficient sales process, per-call routing duration will be decreased, interactive voice response will manage the call routing during busier periods)
-Increased Sales Performance (providing customers with RMs with appropriate knowledge makes the RM's more convincing, hence more likely to make a sale)

3. Skill Enhancement (by providing RM's with a script, customer profile data and outbound calling. Also tracks their performance and gives them a visual medium to encourage improvement)

4. Cost Effective (by reducing per-call handling time)

5. Customer Relationship Management (more loyal/regular customers are prioritised and given RMs with higher skill scores)
