Competitive Advantages:

One of the main attributes towards the success of a company is being able to outperform its competitors in the industry. The system's new ability to appropriately match customers with Relationship Managers with the highest knowledge and skills related to the customer's enquiry (eg. chosen destination) has resulted in multiple competitive advantages for the company.


1. Increased Speed / Decrease in Customer waitime 
The system will improve call routing and dynamic call flow control for inbound and outbound calls, which will lend itself to an efficent sales process. Providing RM's with the customer's profile and a script within seconds, will decrease lead times and increase their delivery in selling the travel packages. Nonetheless, as RM's will be more convincing from obtaining the approriate knowledge of the customer and their enquiry from the company's 'Profiler Tool' in a short time frame, this will increase customer retention.  Customers won't have to wait long periods for RM's to understand the customer's needs and wants and therefore RM's will be able to act efficiently, which will increase their professionalism. In busy periods, an Interactive Voice Response unit will engage with the customer on the call, which will give them the opportunity to provide any additional information and prompt them for options. This information will reduce customer waitime, as the call will automatically redirect them to the first available appropriate RM. 


2. Increased Customer Satisfaction 



(through profile matching, customer data collection and personalised service)

2. Speed (improved call routing and redirection will lend itself to an efficient sales process, per-call routing duration will be decreased, interactive voice response will manage the call routing during busier periods)
-Increased Sales Performance (providing customers with RMs with appropriate knowledge makes the RM's more convincing, hence more likely to make a sale)

3. Skill Enhancement (by providing RM's with a script, customer profile data and outbound calling. Also tracks their performance and gives them a visual medium to encourage improvement)

4. Cost Effective (by reducing per-call handling time)

5. Customer Relationship Management (more loyal/regular customers are prioritised and given RMs with higher skill scores)
