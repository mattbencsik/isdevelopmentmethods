## Design Thinking Approach

Our project exploits a design thinking approach, which is a non-linear, solution-based process to solving problems. It iterates through stages of empathy, problem definition, ideation, prototyping and testing with aim to obtain a final product.

During the empathy stage, empathy maps were created to further analyse the stakeholders, how they are affected by the system and to gain a better understanding of their feelings. We gathered that the RM was mainly concerned with the customer, their rating and selling to them. RM’s recognise the potential to gain experience and increase their skill level (from selling to lower-rated customers). Whereas, customers focus on themselves; their own families; budget; potential enjoyment; and experiences, which are factors in deciding to purchase the holiday package. System developers’ primary goal is to develop a functional system, under time and cost constraints, aiming to satisfy their customer. Finally, the system empathy map shows the pains including any errors or corrupted files and inefficient use of the system and the gains such as increased sales, improved system performance and user interaction through profiling.

Empathising led us to define the problem, starting with the POV statements of the Customer and RM. These are inferences made based on empathising stages (and later stages of design thinking). The customer reveals a need for highly skilled and knowledgeable RM’s who can effectively inform them of their travel package. An insight from customers is that they are limited by the RM’s performance and thus will be unconvinced to purchase the package. Whereas, insights from the RM show potential underperformance and therefore, need to boost their delivery skills and knowledge. Then the backlog of user stories was created and prioritised to help define the problem which includes the ineffective call flow rates and inefficient call routing.  

In the ideate stage, HMW statements were made which spark inspiration for solutions to the above problem. The iterative nature of design thinking allowed us to redefine the problem and improve the objectives in the previous stage. As it is difficult to test an un-interactive, intangible prototype, models are analysed to further improve ideas and better understand the problem and perspective of the users.
