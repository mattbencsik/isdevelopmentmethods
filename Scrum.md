# Scrum Methodology

Scrum is an iterative and incremental process used in software development projects with activities undertaken to ensure requirements and solutions are constantly evolving. Although in this assignment, a software application was not being developed, GitHub and Scrum methodologies were used to understand Agile in the industry. We first defined the problem, identified the stakeholders and outlined assumptions about the current business process. In an agile environment, this is the first iteration and thus, we made a respective branch in GitHub, recording the logic behind this development using commit messages. From this, a backlog was made comprised of user stories followed by point of view and how might we statements. This design thinking stage correlates to start of the scrum sprints.  The next stage in the report, models and prototypes were built to reflect the iterative sprints of the product being built.
