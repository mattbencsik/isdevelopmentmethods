# Scrum Methodology

Scrum is an iterative and incremental process used in projects with activities undertaken to ensure requirements and solutions are constantly evolving. Although an application was not being developed, GitHub and Scrum methodologies were used to understand Agile in the industry. The iterations were made by separate branches in GitHub, recording the logic using commit messages. The backlog of user stories followed by POV and HMW statements correlate to the stages before the scrum sprints. The next stage of models and prototypes were built to reflect the iterative sprints of the product being built considering a tangible product couldn’t be created.

GitHub allows for each team member to provide their own commits to the project which are reviewable before we merge them onto the branch. This gave us the extensibility when changes occurred and allowed us to easily adapt to changes in the requirements. Also, raising “Issues” makes it easier for members to view any problems, errors and thus, fix them in future iterations (robustness). Agile methods also require the team to track the progress tasks to be completed, in progress and completed. This is achieved in the projects tab of GitHub where cards can be created and assigned to prevalent sections.
