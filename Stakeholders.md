# Stakeholders

Stakeholders are any individual or parties that are directly affected by the final outcome of a product or system, and for the CMC, there are a variety of stakeholders. 
 
The Relationship Manager (RM) is a key stakeholder that is responsible for the selling of a holiday package to a customer through the communication means of telephone call; either an inbound or an outbound call. An RM uses a script or guideline, provided by the system, to help improve the overall customer service in the process of selling a holiday package to the customer. The RM's are ultimately responsible for the selling of a holiday package to a customer. 
 
A second stakeholder is the customer who either receives a phone call from an RM to purchase a holiday package or the customer calls the centre and notifies the RM of their desire to purchase a holiday package. The system ranks them with a score between 1-10; the higher the score, the higher the likeliness of a customer to purchase a package, and thus can determine the amount of sales for the CMC. 
 
Another stakeholder is the system developer. The developer is responsible for ensuring the system is maintained of the highest quality and efficiency. They create the guideline or script that an RM uses to help facilitate the sale of a holiday package to a customer. Also, the developer must ensure the confidential information of customers is safeguarded. The developer needs to  ensure the system matches a RM to a customer based on the RM's skill levels to increase overall efficiency of a potential sale. The Interactive Voice Response must also be maintained so that during high-traffic periods so that the customer can be transferred to the next best-matched available RM.
 
The system that is the backbone of the call management centre that is essential for running the business. It forwards calls to match RM's with great product knowledge and conversational skills through a target list with customers to ensure the highest possibility of a potential sale. Furthermore, the system has a Profiler Tool. This stores both personal information and experience of an RM to ensure they are matched with the right customer on either an inbound or outbound call. The system also uses a call routing mechanism which helps minimise costs of calls inbound to the business to help with overhead cost management. It also makes a criterion for a customer, which ranks them with a score from 1-10, based on their likelihood to purchase a product. 


## Effects If The Project/System Fails
 
For the call management centre, there would be drastic effects to the business if the internal system fails.
 
There will be no computer matching between an RM and a customer. This means that random customers will call/be called by a random RM that are not best suited to aid the potentiality of a holiday package sale. This leads to no script/guideline appearing during an outbound call, which leads to decreasing the efficiency of the RM’s performance. This requires the employee to improvise and learn about the customer and their potential to purchase a holiday package during the call, decreasing overall customer relationship management.
 
Furthermore, during busy call times, there would be no ‘Interactive Voice Response Unit’ and thus no automatic call distributor to help queue and manage a large volume of customer calls. This will result in customers hanging up the phone if they are unwilling to wait in which they may not call back. Customers could move to competitor businesses, decreasing sales for the CMC.
