Statement/Problem:

A major Travel Company is wanting to improve their customer service skills during their inbound and outbound calls, which involves the process of selling travel holiday packages to customers (or potential customers). They aim to deliver high level Relationship Managers (RM) to the customer, through implementing a system that will provide assistance to RM's in the process of matching customer profiles using a 'Profiler Tool', with the RM's built profile and skill matrix. This will subsequently help maximise the performance of RM's during their calls, by matching their product knowledge and skills with the end buyer(s) and thus improving customer satisfaction and lead to an increase in sales. 


Objectives:

- Increase purchases of holiday packages by 20% in the next 2 months during inbound and outbound calls. 
- Direct customer calls to the most suitable Relationship Manager (RM) available within a 30 seconds to a 2 minute wait time. 
- The system will adjust the RM and customer profile within 20 minutes - 30 minutes after every call, once the RM has filled the issue form (clarified in Part 5 - Assumptions) 
- The system developer will have this system implemented in the company in 1 months time.
