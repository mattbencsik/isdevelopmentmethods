Statement/Problem:

A major Travel Company is wanting to improve their customer service during their inbound and outbound calls, which involves the process of selling travel holiday packages to customers (or potential customers). Currently, call flow rates aren't been effectively adjusted to suitable Relationship Managers (RM) and the system operation is overcomplicated by the variation of holiday packages available. There aim is to implement a system that will provide assistance to RM's in serving customers, as well as routing calls between high level RM's and the customer. This will be executed through matching customer profiles using a 'Profiler Tool', with the RM's built profile and skill matrix. Subsequently, this will help maximise the performance of RM's during their calls, by matching their product knowledge and skills with the end buyer(s) and thus improving customer satisfaction and lead to an increase in sales. 


Objectives:

- Increase purchases of holiday packages by 20% in the next 2 months during inbound and outbound calls. 
- Direct customer calls to the most suitable Relationship Manager (RM) available within a 30 seconds to a 2 minute wait time. 
- The system will adjust the RM and customer profile within 20 minutes - 30 minutes after every call, once the RM has filled the issue form (clarified in Part 5 - Assumptions) 
- The system developer will have this system implemented in the company in 1 months time.
