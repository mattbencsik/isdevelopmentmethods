Statement/Problem:

A major Travel Company is wanting to improve their customer service during their inbound and outbound calls, which involves the process of selling travel holiday packages to customers (or potential customers). Currently, call flow rates haven't been effectively adjusted to suitable Relationship Managers (RM) and the system operation is overcomplicated by the variation of holiday packages available. Their aim is to implement a system that will provide assistance to RM's in serving customers, as well as routing calls between high level RM's and customers. This will be executed through a Skill Matcher system that will match customer profiles using a 'Profiler Tool', with the RM's built profile and skill matrix. The system will also continuously update the RM's and customer's profile after every call to provide the most current and up-to-date score information. Subsequently, this will help maximise the performance of RM's during their calls, by matching their product knowledge and skills with the end buyer(s) and thus improving customer satisfaction and lead to an increase in sales. 


Objectives:

- Increase purchases of holiday packages by 20% in the next 2 months during inbound and outbound calls
- Decrease per-call handling time so that RM's are more efficient during their shifts (increase call rate per day)
- Increase customer retention by matching high skilled and appropriate RM's to the customer 
- Improve customer service skills by providing RM's with a script and guidelines that suits the customer's enquiry
- Continuously update RM skill score after each call performance to have the most accurate data in the system
